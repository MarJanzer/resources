# Open Data Advocacy

## Resources
- [*Trump's Quiet War on Data*](https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/20/trumps-quiet-war-on-data-begins) provides good background reading on some of the threats to publicly available data, including the impact of budget cuts and data infrastructure neglect.
- The Sunlight Foundation has an incredible [Public Policy for Public Data](http://whatworkscities.sunlightfoundation.com/) guide for advocating for better governmental policies.
- EDGI has [primers on several of the agencies](https://envirodatagov.org/agencyprimers/) that are vulnerable to change and loss. These may be instructive when contacting officials.

## Tips
- Be clear about **why** open data and data accessibility is important to you.
- Include ways in which accessible data is beneficial to federal, state, and local governments.
- Cite [specific policies and specific outcomes](http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/policy/impacts-of-open-data.pdf) that have been beneficial in other places.

## Issues
- [H.R. 1305 - American Community Survey Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1305) Would likely undercount minority populations in federal databases
- [S.2852 - OPEN Government Data Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2852) passed the Senate last year, but [H.R. 5051 - OPEN Government Data Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5051/) stalled in the house
- [Senate bill S.103](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/103/text) and [House bill H.R.482](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/482/text) would prohibit funding from being used "to design, build, maintain, utilize, or provide access to a Federal database of geospatial information on community racial disparities or disparities in access to affordable housing."
- Local law enforcement are not required to report hate crimes to federal law enforcement | [*Patchy reporting undercuts national hate crimes count*](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/8247a1d2f76b4baea2a121186dedf768/ap-patchy-reporting-undercuts-national-hate-crimes-count) | [SPLC's *#ReportHate*](https://www.splcenter.org/reporthate)
- There is currently no registry for officer-involved shootings or citizens killed by police.
- [EPA climate change data is potentially threatened](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-epa-climatechange-idUSKBN15906G)
- [USDA animal welfare data](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/trump-administration-blacks-out-animal-welfare-information) has been removed
- **Don't forget to check for state and local data**. Many states and local government provide data on things like complaints about police, traffic stops, budgets, and other information. If you would like to see more from your state and local governments...let them know! [Public Policy for Public Data](http://whatworkscities.sunlightfoundation.com/#section-h2-09) has examples of successful local policies.
