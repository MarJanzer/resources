#Open Data Advocacy

##Resources
- EDGI has [primers on several of the agencies](https://envirodatagov.org/agencyprimers/) that are vulnerable to change and loss. These may be instructive when contacting officials.

##Issues
- [H.R. 1305 - American Community Survey Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1305) Would likely undercount minority populations in federal databases
- [S.2852 - OPEN Government Data Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2852) passed the Senate last year, but [H.R. 5051 - OPEN Government Data Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5051/) stalled in the house
