##Resources
- EDGI has [primers on several of the agencies](https://envirodatagov.org/agencyprimers/) that are vulnerable to change and loss. These may be instructive when contacting officials.

##Issues
- [H.R. 1305 - American Community Survey Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1305) Would likely undercount minority populations in federal databases
- [S.2852 - OPEN Government Data Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2852) passed the Senate last year, but [H.R. 5051 - OPEN Government Data Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5051/) stalled in the house
- [Senate bill S.103](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/103/text) and [House bill H.R.482](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/482/text) would prohibit funding from being used "to design, build, maintain, utilize, or provide access to a Federal database of geospatial information on community racial disparities or disparities in access to affordable housing."
- Local law enforcement are not required to report hate crimes to federal law enforcement | [*Patchy reporting undercuts national hate crimes count*](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/8247a1d2f76b4baea2a121186dedf768/ap-patchy-reporting-undercuts-national-hate-crimes-count) | [SPLC's *#ReportHate*](https://www.splcenter.org/reporthate)
- There is currently no registry for officer-involved shootings or citizens killed by police.
- [EPA climate change data is potentially threatened](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-epa-climatechange-idUSKBN15906G)
- [USDA animal welfare data](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/trump-administration-blacks-out-animal-welfare-information) has been removed
- Don't forget to check state and local data. Many states and local government provide data
